Made and animation for university asssignment. There are comments in Bulgarian for my taacher and I to understand quicker but might change it later.

The idea is for the red ball to go through an array of toruses two of which are rotating. When the ball collides with one of them the ball bounces off with reflection and the torus turns black and stops moving. The animation restarts if the ball goes off the limits of the window.
